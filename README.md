# Digital Product: Shiftman

## WHY

Why does Shiftman exist? Shiftman was created to simplify and speed up the writing process by automatically converting all keystrokes pressed keys to uppercase and each number to a symbol. This is ideal for users who need to write in uppercase, Capital letters or use symbols frequently, such as when creating content that requires specific formatting or quickly adjusting capitalization in text. By eliminating the need to hold down the Shift key, Shiftman saves time and reduces effort in writing.

As a software developer, I write over 6,000 characters daily, often in CamelCaseFormat, and frequently type over 3,000 symbols. This repetitive task of pressing SHIFT and then the key IS NOT NEEDED... but no one knows because this way of doing things has been happening forever! The monumental effort required to accomplish this routine made me create Shiftman, this changed my life and I know this will change yours!

## WHAT

What is Shiftman? Shiftman is a productivity software that automatically converts every typed letter to uppercase and every number to a symbol. It is designed to enhance writing efficiency by ensuring every keypress registers as an uppercase letter, eliminating the need to use the Shift key.

## HOW

How does Shiftman work? Shiftman works by detecting keyboard input and automatically adjusting the text to convert the key-pressed letter to uppercase or each number key-pressed into the corresponding symbol. Once installed, Shiftman adjusts your keyboard so that every time you press a key, the software converts it to an uppercase letter in real-time, without needing to press the Shift key.
